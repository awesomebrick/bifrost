bifrost, the bridge between worlds, bathed in the colors of the rainbow.

bifrost is a usb-host serial to ii/i2c converter. 
practically speaking, it gives you two usb-a host ports to connect a monome grid, arc, or other class-compliant midi device, and exposes these devices' interfaces over the i2c bus; so that your teletype or crow may have access to more than one grid or arc at a time.
